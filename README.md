# Teamify

Created as a team project for Software Engineering at SJSU, Teamify is a web application that will increase efficiency and efficacy of team formation. Users can create an account to create a profile including a bio, skills, available times, and interests. They can then either create a team of their own (with a name, description, tags, and what they're looking for) or search for an already created one and request to join (with an optional message). The team leader can accept or deny applicants, or they can search the people that have marked themselves as open to joining and invite them (with an optional message). It also supports different environments, so it could be used for multiple classes / purposes at once.

The frontend (in website/) was done by Melanie Chan, while the backend was done by Connor Pietrasik.
